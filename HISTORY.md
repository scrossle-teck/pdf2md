# History (Template)

Use this linear log to track how a project evolved. Keep entries chronological and concise.

## 1) Goals and constraints

- What are we building and why?
- Key constraints (runtime, deps, hosting, data boundaries).

## 2) Initial implementation

- First pass: languages, frameworks, entry points.
- Must-have features and how they’re validated.

## 3) Iterations and decisions

- Added X because Y (tradeoffs).
- Changed A → B due to Z.
- Removed N (out of scope).

## 4) Testing and quality gates

- Unit test coverage focus areas.
- What blocks a merge/release (if any)?

## 5) Current state

- Commands/features available.
- Known limitations.

## 6) Next steps

- Near-term improvements and nice-to-haves.

Guidelines

- Keep it linear and readable; one can reconstruct the project story.
- Link PRs/issues where relevant.
